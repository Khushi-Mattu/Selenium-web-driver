# Selenium
<p>
  First we have to download the web driver from chrome. Then first import webdriver from selenium. Then we have to specify the path of the webdriver. 
  </p>
  <p> we have to get the url by using driver.get("url"). To close the tab we can do driver.close() but to close the entire browser we have to use driver.quit(). we can get the title of the page by print(driver.title)</p>
