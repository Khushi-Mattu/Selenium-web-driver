  So, I had a lot of problems setting up selenium on my vscode. First of all we have to download the chrome web driver (you can just search on google).
  Then is the most IMPORTANT step. My file wouldnt work without this. You have to create a virtual environment after opening the folder in vscode. After that use pip install 
  selenium in the terminal line. After this, it should work.
